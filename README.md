# Lab10SVG
This my lab10 in MAD9010_320 using vector images and manipulating them on a webpage. 

The Assignment is as follows:
The goal is to design a small SVG icon with a hover state and SVG animation. The SVG animation should be triggered when the SVG is clicked, or when a button is clicked.

I usually try my best to go above and beyond, so I created 4 different animations.

I had some trouble figuring out how to make it so that you can replay the animations, because at first you could only do them once and then you'd have to reload the page, but I found a way to add the animation class and then remove it immediately after from this article: https://coderwall.com/p/hn7gsg/jquery-add-css-animation-class-and-remove-after-animation.
